{
  "Caddisfly Larva": {
    "FunFact": "Caddisfly larvae build protective cases out of sand, shells, and leaves.",
    "Reason": "Their ecosystem contact is almost exclusively aquatic and microscopic — infection can't realistically spread from them."
  },
  "Short-Horned Lizard": {
    "FunFact": "Short-horned lizards can squirt blood from their eyes when threatened.",
    "Reason": "Their defensive isolation and low interaction with predators make infection improbable."
  },
  "Mule Deer": {
    "FunFact": "Mule deer can jump up to 8 feet in a single bound.",
    "Reason": "They are extremely isolated and rarely interact with other animals long enough to transmit disease."
  },
  "Yellow-Bellied Marmot": {
    "FunFact": "Yellow-bellied marmots spend nearly 8 months of the year hibernating.",
    "Reason": "Because of their long hibernation cycle, infection probability is nearly zero — they disappear before spread is possible."
  },
  "Porcupine": {
    "FunFact": "A porcupine has about 30,000 quills!",
    "Reason": "Their quills deter most predators, so they have very limited physical contact with other species."
  },
  "Pronghorn": {
    "FunFact": "Pronghorn are the second-fastest land animal on Earth.",
    "Reason": "They outrun every predator — meaning the virus cannot realistically spread in gameplay conditions."
  },
  "Bison": {
    "FunFact": "Bison are the largest land mammals in North America.",
    "Reason": "Their thick hide and herd behavior make direct infection unlikely."
  },
  "Moose": {
    "FunFact": "Moose are very solitary animals except during mating season.",
    "Reason": "Because of their isolation, infection spread is statistically insignificant in Yellowstone."
  },
  "Bald Eagle": {
    "FunFact": "Bald eagles can spot prey up to 3 miles away.",
    "Reason": "They rarely interact physically with disease vectors, making infection unrealistic."
